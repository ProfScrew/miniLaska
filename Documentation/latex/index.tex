The mini\+Laska is a small version of the original game \href{http://www.laska.org}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+laska.\+org}}

Limitation of the game\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item can conquer/eat only once per turn
\item the max height of the stack is 3 max, if limit exceded the pawn is removed
\item if none of the players wins in 100 moves the game is a draw
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_compile_sec}{}\doxysection{Compile}\label{index_compile_sec}
In this section will stated how to make the game run and the requiments for it.\hypertarget{index_require_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Required gcc}\label{index_require_sec}
Make sure that you have gcc installed. If its not installed, here is a small guide on how to do it using a terminal\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Start by updating the packages list\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  sudo apt update
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Install the {\bfseries{build-\/essential}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  sudo apt install build-essential
\end{DoxyVerb}

\item Validate if installed using the following comand \begin{DoxyVerb}  gcc --version
\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{index_compilatio_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Compilation}\label{index_compilatio_sec}
To compile the program make use of the {\bfseries{Makefile}} by using only the simple comand in the same folder\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}     make
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This comand will execute the following command to compile the game\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}     gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wno-unused-result -O2 src/main.c src/board.c src/move.c src/participants.c -o miniLaska
\end{DoxyVerb}
 It has the following parameters\+:

-\/ansi\+: tells the compiler to implement the ANSI language option. This turns off certain \char`\"{}features\char`\"{} of GCC which are incompatible with the ANSI standard.

-\/pedantic used in conjunction with -\/ansi, this tells the compiler to be adhere strictly to the ANSI standard, rejecting any code which is not compliant.

-\/Wno-\/unused-\/result means that it will ignore the unused result warning, which occurs during the usage of the \uline{scanf()} comand\hypertarget{index_exe_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Execution}\label{index_exe_sec}
To execute the program use the file {\bfseries{mini\+Laska}} created by the previous command. \begin{DoxyVerb}     ./miniLaska
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{index_menu_sec}{}\doxysection{Main Menu}\label{index_menu_sec}
When the program is started the menu will appear with the following options\+:\hypertarget{index_game_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Play Game}\label{index_game_sec}
Allows the user to play the game. The user has then the following choice\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Player vs Player
\item Player vs Random
\item Player vs CPU Scan
\item Player vs CPU Eat
\end{DoxyItemize}

And after choosing the following game will start.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Also the user has the choice of which side he wants to play.
\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
If the user during the game makes 5 mistakes consecutively(inserts invalid number) the program will terminate
\end{DoxyWarning}
\hypertarget{index_test_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Test CPU vs CPU}\label{index_test_sec}
This option allows user to test the cpus and see the resault.

To use this the user need to insert the number of tests he wants to perform

and what type of test.

There are two types of test\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item single\+: Here the user will have to choose the cpus that will fight each other
\item full\+: This option will test all the combination of the cpus so the number of test will be multiplied by 9
\end{DoxyItemize}

The three cpus are\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{participants_8c_a2d72fbbec92d93d750b06af8a30f8f45}{cpu\+Move\+Random}}\+: it randomly chooses the option.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{group__cpuScan__group_gaa51724f27e2e5f5575337e8dd406e8c1}{cpu\+Scan}}\+: analizes in depth all possibility and gives each posibility towards the end a value (\mbox{\hyperlink{group__cpuScan__group_ga2294cbaf993c07d8bfeca0c801f52d92}{value\+Of\+Board}}), these values are then added and devided by the number of outcomes and the end the cpu chooses the best outcome.
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{group__cpuScan__group_gaa51724f27e2e5f5575337e8dd406e8c1}{cpu\+Scan}}\+: analizes in depth all posibility and if there is an capture a certain value is added after that che cpu will determine the option with the highest value of captures and choose it.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The draw function was implemente because on some positions the cpus entered a loop
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{index_setting_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Setting depth CPU}\label{index_setting_sec}
Here the user can setup the depth of each cpu. If the depth is invalid it will go to the default settings.\hypertarget{index_exit_sec}{}\doxysubsection{Exit}\label{index_exit_sec}
Terminates the program.
